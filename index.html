    <h3>About Ahmed Alsubai, High School Student at Millennium Brooklyn High School</h3>

      <p> I'm a highschool student, that attends Millennium Brooklyn High School in New York City. 
      I’ve attended one of the best middle schools in New York city, William Alexander M.S. 51. 
      I believe myself to be a talented and bright individual that continuously strives to set myself apart
      from others and improve myself. Whenever I get an opportunity I take it and use it to it’s fullest. </p>
      
     <p> I am 16 years old and the oldest of my 4 other siblings and I try to set a good example for them daily. 
     I have 3 sisters and 1 brother, who is the youngest of the siblings. On my free time I typically try 
     to get outside the house and go hangout with friends, and try to go to different places. I love to play 
     sports, but my favorite one is soccer. My other hobbies include playing video games and reading. 
     Academically I do very well in school, I always get above a 91 average and always have good relationships
     with my teachers. I love Computer science, Math, and science class in school. However I hate history and 
     spanish class. </p>
    
     <p>Outside of school I attend a variety of volunteer programs. Some of these are, volunteering at NYU 
     Lutheran Hospital and volunteering at New York Methodist Hospital. I have a variety of possible careers
     that I wish to pursue, some of which are becoming a doctor and becoming a programer. It’s a very tough 
     decision on which career path I should choose, but the volunteering experience and programs that I join,
     help me better understand which one of these careers is right for me. </p>
